<h2>In no specific order.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Every frame was a painting, wonderful story, twists and turns, best art style in recent memory.</p>
<h3>The Boy and the Heron</h3>
<p>A thought-provoking film, amazing art and immense detail. A nice callback in the modern era of anime.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>One of the best soundtracks to grace a film in years, stacked cast and impactful scenes with a lasting message.</p>
